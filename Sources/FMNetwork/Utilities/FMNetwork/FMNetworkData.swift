        Exhaustive list of the current Core Telephony constants:

            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyNR
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyNRNSA
        * 4G:
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyLTE
        * 3G (GSM):
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyWCDMA
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyHSDPA
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyeHRPD
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyHSUPA
        * 3G (CDMA):
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyCDMA1x
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyCDMAEVDORev0
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyCDMAEVDORevA
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyCDMAEVDORevB
        * 2G:
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyEdge
        * 1G:
            * CTRadioAccessTechnologyGPRS
             
    Please refer to the Core Telephony constants documentation for more informations. [More informations here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coretelephony/cttelephonynetworkinfo/radio_access_technology_constants)
     
    - Warning: This variable returns "" (empty String) in case no value was not found.
    - Attention: These values are decodable as String values and will likely have the share the same raw values as the one listed above. However, as Apple might change these raw values in future OS updates, it is better to use the Core Telephony constants that will handle the change of the raw values for you, automatically. Using Core Telephony constants make your project future-proof.

    - Important: Use the name propery instead.
